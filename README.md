# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-QTL
Welcome to the Brain Tumor Classification Using Quantum Transfer Learning project! This repository showcases an innovative approach to brain tumor classification by leveraging Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL). By integrating quantum gates like Hadamard, CNOT, and Ry, this project aims to push the boundaries of medical image classification.

## Overview
This project explores the efficacy of Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL) in the realm of brain tumor classification, comparing its performance against traditional transfer learning methodologies. The core idea is to enhance classification accuracy and robustness by employing quantum computing principles.

## Key Features
Quantum Gate Integration: Implemented Hadamard, CNOT, and Ry gates to construct the quantum transfer learning model.
Traditional vs. Quantum: Compared the performance of QTL with traditional transfer learning models, including ResNet and other state-of-the-art models from research papers.
Extensive Testing: Evaluated the robustness of the models with various data augmentation techniques.

## Inference
Our findings indicate that while Quantum Transfer Learning shows promise, it requires a significantly larger dataset compared to traditional approaches. For this specific problem, QTL did not surpass the performance of traditional models like ResNet but demonstrated comparable results with some research paper models and traditional models.

## Work Done
Quantum Gate Variations: Experimented with different quantum gate combinations, including:

Angle Embedding Layer
BasicEntangler Layers
PauliZ, Hadamard, CNOT, and Ry gates
Model Implementation: Implemented and tested various models from research papers and traditional feature extractors to benchmark the performance of the quantum approach.

Data Augmentation: Applied different data augmentation techniques to evaluate model robustness. Some models performed exceptionally well with simpler augmentations, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of the quantum approach.

## Repository Structure
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code and experiments for quantum and traditional transfer learning.
Models: Pre-trained models and scripts for training new models.
Results: Detailed results and analysis of the experiments.
